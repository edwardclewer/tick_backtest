# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please run the latest released version of Tick Backtest. Security fixes are applied to `main` and rolled into tagged releases; older tags are not patched retroactively.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue or suspect a vulnerability:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Email `security@tickbacktest.dev` with:
   - A description of the issue and potential impact.
   - Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code.
   - Any suggested mitigations.

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and keep you informed as we investigate and remediate the issue. When feasible we will coordinate disclosure timelines so that users can patch before public announcement.

Thank you for helping keep Tick Backtest safe for everyone.
